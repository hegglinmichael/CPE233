#Our team wrote an interrupt driven program that will turn the LEDs on or off. 
#Every interrupt will alternately turns on/off the LEDs. The LEDs that change are the ones
# corresponding to the value on the switches. If the switch for a specific bit is 1, 
#the corresponding bit on the LEDs will change from on to off or off to on.

#When the button is pressed, the program will light up the LEDs that were turned on before
